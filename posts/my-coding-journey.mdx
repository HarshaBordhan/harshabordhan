- Starting a journey in web development can be a daunting task, especially if
  you're starting from scratch. I know this all too well, as I was in the same
  boat just a few years ago. However, with the right mindset and resources,
  anyone can learn the basics of web development and take the first steps
  towards a rewarding career in the tech industry.

- When I first decided to start learning web development, I had no prior
  experience with coding. I was inspired by a book that I read that talked about
  the importance of learning to code in today's digital world. I took this as a
  sign that I needed to start learning, and I haven't looked back since.

My journey began with learning the basics of HTML and CSS. These two languages
are essential for building the structure and design of web pages. I found that
learning these languages was relatively easy, and I was able to create simple
web pages with just a few lines of code.

However, the real challenge for me was learning JavaScript. This programming
language is used to create dynamic and interactive web applications, and it
can be quite difficult to understand at first. But I didn't give up. I kept
learning and practising, I read books, articles and tutorials, I took online
courses and I also joined a community of developers.

After a few months of learning and practice, I was able to create simple web
applications using JavaScript. It was a great feeling to see my code come to
life and see the results of my hard work.

Now, I am a web developer with several projects under my belt, and I am
constantly learning new technologies and frameworks. I am so glad I took the
first step towards learning web development.

If you're reading this and you're thinking about starting your own coding
journey, don't be intimidated by the thought of learning a new skill. It's not
easy, but it's definitely worth it. Start with the basics and keep learning.
And remember, it's never too late to start something new.
